## DR. PHIL.
I graduated as a Dr. Phil. in Systematic Musicology & worked as a Research Fellow at the Max-Planck-Institute for empirical Aesthetics. I studied how music fulfils a self-empowering function using methods from cognitive and behavioural psychology, carrying out experiments in the lab, and analysing lots of data.
